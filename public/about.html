<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Greetings! I’m Liam Roberts, a freelance graphic designer with a keen eye for detail and a passion for creative innovation.
   With a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design from the Savannah College of Art and Design, I have over 6 years of experience crafting 
   visually compelling designs for a variety of clients.
   My portfolio includes branding projects, digital illustrations, web design, and print media. I’ve had the pleasure of working with startups,
   non-profits, and established brands, helping them communicate their message through powerful visual storytelling. One of my notable projects 
   was rebranding XYZ Non-Profit, which led to a 40% increase in donor engagement and a more cohesive brand identity.
   In addition to client work, I love experimenting with new design trends and techniques, often sharing my insights through tutorials and blog posts.
   When I’m not designing, you can find me exploring art galleries, attending design workshops, or enjoying a good book with a cup of coffee. 
   My mission is to bring ideas to life through design and make the world a more beautiful place, one project at a time. </p>
